#Select2 for rails asset pipeline

[Select2](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2) is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results.

The `select2-rails` gem integrates the `Select2` jQuery plugin with the Rails asset pipeline.

## Version
From `v2.1.0` on, `select2-rails`'s version will match the version of `Select2` it uses.

The last number of the version is the patch version specific to the gem. For example, for a version of the form `2.x.y`, `2.x` is the release of `Select2` we should be compatible with, and y is the patch version specific to the gem (ie. to resolve any gem-specific issues that crop up).
